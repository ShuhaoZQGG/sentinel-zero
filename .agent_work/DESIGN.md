## Summary

I've successfully completed the Design Phase for Cycle 5 of the SentinelZero project:

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Analyzed existing UI components (Dashboard already implemented)
2. ✅ Reviewed DESIGN.md - comprehensive UI/UX specifications already exist
3. ✅ Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md with design phase completion

### Key Findings
The DESIGN.md file already contains extensive UI/UX specifications including:
- **Complete CLI Design**: Command structure, all core commands with Issue #10 and #11 fixes
- **Web Dashboard Design**: Full layouts for Dashboard, Process Details, Schedules, and Settings pages
- **Design System**: Color palette, typography, spacing, component library
- **User Journeys**: Process management, scheduling, and monitoring flows
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance specifications
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Performance Optimizations**: Code splitting, virtual scrolling

### Design Highlights
- Material-UI v5 component system
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- WebSocket for real-time process updates
- Recharts for metrics visualization
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

### Ready for Implementation
The design specifications are complete and ready for the implementation phase to build:
1. Process Details page with tabbed interface
2. Schedules page with calendar view  
3. Settings page with configuration management

The design fully addresses all core features from README.md and provides a solid foundation for implementation.
