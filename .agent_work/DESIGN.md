The repository doesn't have a remote configured yet. The design phase is complete with all specifications saved locally in DESIGN.md.

## Summary

I've successfully completed the UI/UX design phase for SentinelZero:

✅ **Created DESIGN.md** with comprehensive specifications including:
- CLI command structure for all core features (process management, scheduling, policies, monitoring)
- Output formatting with status indicators and color schemes
- Configuration file format (YAML)
- Error handling patterns
- Interactive features and accessibility requirements
- Performance targets and user journey maps

✅ **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with:
- Completed design phase items
- Design decisions (YAML config, click CLI framework)
- Technical recommendations for development phase

✅ **Committed changes** with message: "feat(cycle-1): UI/UX design specifications"

The design ensures all core features from README.md have corresponding UI specifications, with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and consistency in the CLI interface.
