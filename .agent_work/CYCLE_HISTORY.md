#### Handoff Notes
## Completed Work
### React Dashboard UI Implementation ✅
- **Review**: Completed with decision: APPROVED
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 2)
- Fully functional Dashboard component with process monitoring
- Real-time metrics display cards (CPU, Memory, Running processes, Scheduled tasks)
- Process list table with complete status and resource information
- Interactive process controls (start/stop/restart)
- Auto-refresh functionality with 5-second intervals
- Visual status indicators using Material-UI icons and chips
- Click-through navigation to process details

### WebSocket Service Integration ✅
- Complete WebSocket service for real-time updates
- Event listeners for all process status changes
- Real-time metrics streaming support
- Log entry streaming capability
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- Subscription management for processes and metrics

### Redux State Management Enhancements ✅
- Enhanced processesSlice with full CRUD operations
- Added async thunks for all API calls
- Implemented comprehensive metricsSlice
- Created new logsSlice for output streaming
- Proper TypeScript interfaces throughout

### Test Results ✅
- All 68 tests passing
- 19 tests skipped (API integration tests)
- No test failures
- Complete backward compatibility maintained

## Pending Items
### High Priority
- Database-backed authentication (currently in-memory)
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Complete API integration tests
- Production deployment configuration

### Medium Priority
- Process Details page implementation
- Schedules management page
- Settings page with configuration
- Log viewer with filtering

### Low Priority
- Docker containerization
- Mobile responsive design
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Export functionality

## Technical Decisions
- Used Material-UI for consistent UI components
- Socket.io-client for WebSocket connections
- Redux Toolkit for simplified state management
- TypeScript for type safety throughout
- Auto-refresh pattern for real-time updates

## Known Issues
- Authentication still uses in-memory store (needs database backend)
- API integration tests require running FastAPI server
- WebSocket reconnection needs production testing
- Some React components still scaffolded (ProcessDetails, Schedules, Settings)

## Next Steps
1. **Database Integration**
   - Set up PostgreSQL for authentication
   - Migrate from in-memory user store
   - Add proper session management

2. **Complete Remaining UI Pages**
   - Process Details with logs viewer
   - Schedules management interface
   - Settings configuration page

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Add Prometheus metrics
   - Implement proper logging
   - Create Docker deployment
   - Add CI/CD pipeline

4. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Complete API integration tests
   - Add E2E tests for React app
   - Create user documentation
   - API documentation with OpenAPI

## Files Modified in Cycle 3
- sentinel-web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx - Complete UI implementation
- sentinel-web/src/services/websocket.ts - New WebSocket service
- sentinel-web/src/store/slices/logsSlice.ts - New logs management
- sentinel-web/src/store/slices/processesSlice.ts - Enhanced with async operations
