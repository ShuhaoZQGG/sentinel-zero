# Cycle History

This document tracks the history of all development cycles for continuous improvement.

## Cycle Summary

| Cycle | Start Date | End Date | Status | Branch | PR URL | Key Decisions |

## Detailed History


### Cycle 1
- Started: 
- Completed: Mon  1 Sep 2025 12:48:54 EDT
- Status: completed
- Decision: APPROVED
- Branch: cycle-1-start-project-20250831-214755

#### Handoff Notes
## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Review**: Completed with decision: APPROVED
- **Cycle 1**: Core implementation with process management, scheduling, and CLI
- **Cycle 6**: Fixed GitHub issues #10 and #11
  - CLI argument parsing for long strings (using shlex)
  - Custom restart delays with time formats (5h, 30m, etc.)
- **Review**: PR #18 approved and merged to main branch

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Integration testing for end-to-end workflows
- Configuration file support (YAML/JSON)
- REST API implementation
- Web dashboard development
- Advanced health checks
- launchd integration for macOS service

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Used shlex module for proper command parsing
- Created time_parser utility for human-readable time formats
- Maintained backward compatibility with numeric delay values
- SQLAlchemy with declarative_base (needs update to 2.0 style)

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- SQLAlchemy deprecation warning for declarative_base()
- No integration tests yet
- Missing configuration file support
- No REST API implemented

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Address remaining open GitHub issues (if any)
2. Implement configuration file support
3. Add integration tests
4. Begin REST API development
5. Update SQLAlchemy to use 2.0 style declarations
