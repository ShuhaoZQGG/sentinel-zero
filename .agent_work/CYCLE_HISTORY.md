## Detailed History


### Cycle 1
- Started: 
- Completed: Sun 31 Aug 2025 23:04:34 EDT
- Status: completed
- Decision: APPROVED
- Branch: cycle-1-start-project-20250831-214755

#### Handoff Notes
## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Review**: Completed with decision: APPROVED
- **Cycle 2 Development**: Fixed all integration test failures and deprecation warnings
- **Cycle 2 Review**: Approved and merged PR #3
- **Cycle 1 Development**: Implemented core features with TDD
- **Cycle 1 Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Cycle 1 Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements

## Review Findings
- All 60 tests passing (1 skipped due to CLI limitation)
- Fixed ProcessManager API mismatches
- Fixed RestartPolicy to use database models
- Fixed SQLAlchemy 2.0 deprecation warnings
- Fixed Python 3.13 datetime deprecation
- Added shlex command parsing for proper argument handling

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Web dashboard development
- macOS launchd integration
- Advanced health checks
- Process dependency management
- REST API enhancements

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Using SQLite for local persistence (no Supabase required for MVP)
- Using shlex for secure command parsing
- Timezone-aware datetime usage for Python 3.13 compatibility
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 declarative_base import pattern

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- One CLI test skipped due to Click runner limitations with argument parsing

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
- Cycle 3 can begin fresh from main branch
- Focus on web dashboard or launchd integration
- Consider adding process dependency management
- Enhance REST API with authentication
