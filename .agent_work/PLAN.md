   - Bug fixes for CLI argument parsing (Issues #10, #11)
   - Production stability improvements
   - Database-backed authentication
   - Prometheus metrics integration
   - Docker containerization and CI/CD pipeline

3. **Git workflow established**:
   - Branch: `cycle-4-ðŸš€-features-20250901-101927`
