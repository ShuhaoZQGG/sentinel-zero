## Summary

Planning phase completed successfully. Created comprehensive project architecture for SentinelZero:

### Key Deliverables:
- **README.md**: Structured with Core Features, tracking project progress
- **PLAN.md**: Complete architectural blueprint including:
  - Python 3.11+ with SQLite database
  - Modular component architecture
  - 5-phase implementation roadmap
  - Database schema for processes, schedules, policies, and metrics
- **CYCLE_HANDOFF.md**: Phase transition documentation

### Architecture Highlights:
- **Tech Stack**: Python/psutil/APScheduler/SQLAlchemy/click
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight persistence
- **Components**: Process Manager, Scheduler, Monitor, Restart Policy
- **Interface**: CLI-first with optional REST API

### Git Status:
- Branch `cycle-1-start-project-20250831-214755` created and committed locally
- Note: Remote repository needs to be configured for PR creation

Ready for design phase to detail component interfaces and API specifications.
RESULT: Architecture planning completed successfully

=== UI-FEATURE-DESIGNER PHASE - Sun 31 Aug 2025 21:50:01 EDT ===
The repository doesn't have a remote configured yet. The design phase is complete with all specifications saved locally in DESIGN.md.

## Summary

I've successfully completed the UI/UX design phase for SentinelZero:

✅ **Created DESIGN.md** with comprehensive specifications including:
- CLI command structure for all core features (process management, scheduling, policies, monitoring)
- Output formatting with status indicators and color schemes
- Configuration file format (YAML)
- Error handling patterns
- Interactive features and accessibility requirements
- Performance targets and user journey maps

✅ **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with:
- Completed design phase items
- Design decisions (YAML config, click CLI framework)
- Technical recommendations for development phase

✅ **Committed changes** with message: "feat(cycle-1): UI/UX design specifications"

The design ensures all core features from README.md have corresponding UI specifications, with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and consistency in the CLI interface.
RESULT: UI/UX design completed successfully

=== DEVELOPER-AGENT PHASE - Sun 31 Aug 2025 21:52:25 EDT (Attempt 1) ===
RESULT: Development completed successfully
RESULT: Skipping testing phase - going directly to review

=== PR-REVIEWER PHASE - Mon  1 Sep 2025 12:43:42 EDT ===
## Review Complete

✅ **PR #18 has been APPROVED and MERGED**

### Summary:
- Reviewed cycle-6 implementation fixing GitHub issues #10 and #11
- All 40 tests passing (12 new tests for cycle-6 fixes)
- PR successfully merged to main branch
- Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md with completed work
- Created NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md with prioritized future work

The cycle-6 implementation successfully addresses both open GitHub issues with clean, well-tested code. The project now has a solid foundation with core process management, scheduling, and CLI functionality. Next priorities should focus on configuration management, REST API development, and integration testing.
RESULT: Cycle completed - APPROVED
