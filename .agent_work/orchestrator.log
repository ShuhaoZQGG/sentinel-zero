## Summary

Planning phase completed successfully. Created comprehensive project architecture for SentinelZero:

### Key Deliverables:
- **README.md**: Structured with Core Features, tracking project progress
- **PLAN.md**: Complete architectural blueprint including:
  - Python 3.11+ with SQLite database
  - Modular component architecture
  - 5-phase implementation roadmap
  - Database schema for processes, schedules, policies, and metrics
- **CYCLE_HANDOFF.md**: Phase transition documentation

### Architecture Highlights:
- **Tech Stack**: Python/psutil/APScheduler/SQLAlchemy/click
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight persistence
- **Components**: Process Manager, Scheduler, Monitor, Restart Policy
- **Interface**: CLI-first with optional REST API

### Git Status:
- Branch `cycle-1-start-project-20250831-214755` created and committed locally
- Note: Remote repository needs to be configured for PR creation

Ready for design phase to detail component interfaces and API specifications.
RESULT: Architecture planning completed successfully

=== UI-FEATURE-DESIGNER PHASE - Sun 31 Aug 2025 21:50:01 EDT ===
The repository doesn't have a remote configured yet. The design phase is complete with all specifications saved locally in DESIGN.md.

## Summary

I've successfully completed the UI/UX design phase for SentinelZero:

âœ… **Created DESIGN.md** with comprehensive specifications including:
- CLI command structure for all core features (process management, scheduling, policies, monitoring)
- Output formatting with status indicators and color schemes
- Configuration file format (YAML)
- Error handling patterns
- Interactive features and accessibility requirements
- Performance targets and user journey maps

âœ… **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with:
- Completed design phase items
- Design decisions (YAML config, click CLI framework)
- Technical recommendations for development phase

âœ… **Committed changes** with message: "feat(cycle-1): UI/UX design specifications"

The design ensures all core features from README.md have corresponding UI specifications, with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and consistency in the CLI interface.
RESULT: UI/UX design completed successfully

- âœ… Resolved deprecation warnings (SQLAlchemy 2.0, Python 3.13)
- âœ… Enhanced CLI with proper command parsing
- âœ… No security vulnerabilities found
- âœ… Clean architecture maintained

### Documents Updated:
- REVIEW.md - Added Cycle 2 review with APPROVED decision
- CYCLE_HANDOFF.md - Updated with Cycle 2 completion status
- NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md - Marked completed items from Cycle 2

The project is now ready for Cycle 3 development with all core features working properly. Next developer should start fresh from the updated main branch.
RESULT: Cycle completed - APPROVED

## Review Complete - PR #8 APPROVED and MERGED âœ…

### Summary
I've successfully reviewed and merged PR #8 for Cycle 3's enterprise features implementation. The PR delivers:

- **REST API** with FastAPI, JWT authentication, and WebSocket support
- **React Dashboard UI** with real-time monitoring and Material-UI
- **macOS launchd integration** for system service deployment
- **68 tests passing** with 0 failures

### Decision
<!-- CYCLE_DECISION: APPROVED -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- DESIGN_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

### Actions Taken
1. âœ… Reviewed code quality and architecture
2. âœ… Verified PR targets main branch correctly
3. âœ… Validated test coverage (68 passing, 19 skipped API tests)
4. âœ… **Merged PR #8 to main** using squash merge
5. âœ… Updated REVIEW.md with comprehensive review
6. âœ… Created NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md for Cycle 4 planning

### Next Cycle Recommendations
Cycle 4 should focus on production readiness:
1. Database-backed authentication (replace in-memory store)
2. Complete remaining UI pages
3. Docker deployment configuration
4. End-to-end testing setup

The project has successfully evolved from a CLI tool to a comprehensive process management platform with enterprise features.
RESULT: Cycle completed - APPROVED
