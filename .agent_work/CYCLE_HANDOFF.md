# Cycle 3 Handoff Document

Generated: Sun 31 Aug 2025

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 3
- Branch: cycle-3-âœ…-all-20250831-231630
- Phase: development (attempt 1)

## Completed Work
### REST API (FastAPI)
- Full REST API implementation with all planned endpoints
- JWT authentication with token refresh
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- OpenAPI documentation
- CORS middleware configured
- Rate limiting ready

### Web Dashboard (React)
- React 18 + TypeScript scaffold created
- Material-UI components integrated
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Authentication flow with protected routes
- WebSocket client setup
- Vite build configuration

### macOS launchd Integration
- Complete plist configuration file
- Installation and uninstallation scripts
- Daemon command added to CLI
- Auto-restart on crash configured
- Log management setup

### Testing
- API test suite created (18 test cases)
- launchd integration tests (8 test cases passing)
- Core functionality maintained (67 tests passing)

## Pending Items
- React components need full UI implementation (currently scaffolded)
- API integration tests need to be run with FastAPI installed
- Production authentication backend (currently in-memory)
- WebSocket connection pooling for scale

## Technical Decisions
- FastAPI chosen for modern async capabilities and auto-documentation
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Material-UI for consistent design system
- Redux Toolkit for simplified state management
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Vite for fast frontend development

## Known Issues
- One daemon command test needs adjustment for mocking
- Web dashboard UI is minimal (scaffold only)
- Authentication uses in-memory store (needs database)

## Next Steps
- Complete React component implementations
- Add comprehensive API integration tests
- Implement production database for authentication
- Add monitoring and alerting features
- Create Docker deployment configuration
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Performance optimization and caching
- Consider mobile app development

## Files Added in Cycle 3
- src/api/* - Complete REST API implementation
- sentinel-web/* - React dashboard application
- launchd/* - macOS service integration
- tests/test_api.py - API test suite
- tests/test_launchd.py - launchd integration tests
