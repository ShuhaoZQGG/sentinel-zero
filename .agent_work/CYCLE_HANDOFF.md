## Current State
- Cycle Number: 4
- Branch: cycle-4-ðŸš€-features-20250901-101927
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive PLAN.md created with focus on production readiness
- **Architecture Analysis**: Reviewed all existing documentation and implementation
- **Issue Tracking**: Identified GitHub issues #10 and #11 for CLI argument parsing bugs
- **Branch Created**: cycle-4-ðŸš€-features-20250901-101927
- **PR Ready**: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/sentinel-zero/pull/new/cycle-4-%F0%9F%9A%80-features-20250901-101927

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Fix CLI argument parsing bugs (Issues #10, #11)
- Implement database-backed authentication (currently in-memory)
- Add FastAPI to requirements.txt
- Create integration tests for API endpoints

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- **Database Strategy**: Migrate from in-memory to SQLAlchemy-backed authentication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics integration for production observability
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for consistent deployments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- GitHub Issue #10: CLI argument parsing error
- GitHub Issue #11: Additional CLI parsing problems
- Missing dependency: FastAPI not in requirements.txt
- Authentication uses in-memory store (security concern for production)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. **Design Phase**: Create detailed implementation specs for bug fixes
2. **Implementation Phase**: Fix CLI bugs and add database authentication
3. **Testing Phase**: Add integration tests for API and CLI
4. **Deployment Phase**: Create Docker configuration and CI/CD pipeline
