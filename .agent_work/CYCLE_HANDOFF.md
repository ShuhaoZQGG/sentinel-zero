## Current State
- Cycle Number: 5
- Branch: cycle-5-all-planned-20250901-133843
- Phase: planning (complete)

## Completed Work
- Analyzed existing project state: All planned features through Cycle 5 are complete
- Created comprehensive architectural plan for future enhancements
- Identified next evolution priorities: multi-tenancy, workflow orchestration, mobile app
- Documented Supabase integration opportunities using MCP tools

## Pending Items
- Design phase needs to detail multi-tenant database architecture
- Consider workflow engine selection (Airflow vs Prefect vs custom)
- Mobile app technology stack finalization
- Resource allocation and team sizing decisions

## Technical Decisions
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Schema-per-tenant approach for data isolation
- **Workflow Engine**: Evaluate Apache Airflow for DAG orchestration
- **Mobile Framework**: React Native for cross-platform development
- **Supabase Integration**: Consider migration from SQLite to Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Extend to support SSO (SAML/OAuth/OIDC)

## Known Issues
- None identified - all previous issues resolved

## Next Steps
1. Design detailed multi-tenant database schema
2. Create workflow DSL specification
3. Design mobile app UI/UX mockups
4. Plan migration strategy from SQLite to PostgreSQL/Supabase
5. Define API versioning strategy for backward compatibility
