## Current State
- Cycle Number: 3
- Branch: cycle-3-perfect-ive-20250831-234439
- Phase: design (complete)

## Completed Work
- ✅ Analyzed project vision and existing implementation
- ✅ **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements in PLAN.md
- ✅ Created comprehensive Cycle 4 development plan in PLAN.md
- ✅ Identified key architectural decisions for production readiness
- ✅ Established 5-phase implementation strategy
- ✅ Created and pushed branch: cycle-3-perfect-ive-20250831-234439
- ✅ Committed PLAN.md with architectural planning
- ✅ **Design**: Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
- ✅ Defined user journeys and component architecture
- ✅ Created dashboard and process detail wireframes
- ✅ Specified responsive design and accessibility requirements
- ✅ Integrated Supabase capabilities into design considerations

## Pending Items
- Complete React dashboard implementation (currently scaffold only)
- Set up PostgreSQL for authentication database
- Implement WebSocket real-time data flow
- Replace in-memory auth with persistent storage
- Add Prometheus metrics and alerting
- Implement all UI components specified in DESIGN.md

## Technical Decisions
- Use PostgreSQL for production auth/users database
- Add Redis for caching and real-time data
- Keep SQLite for local process data
- Leverage Supabase for managed backend services
- Use React Query for API state management
- Implement atomic design pattern for frontend
- Material-UI v5 for component library
- Recharts for data visualization
- Socket.io for WebSocket management

## Design Constraints for Development
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Component Library**: Material-UI v5
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + React Query
- **Real-time**: Socket.io client for WebSocket
- **Charts**: Recharts for visualizations
- **Auth UI**: Supabase Auth components
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach (320px+)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Known Issues
- One daemon test needs mock adjustment (non-blocking)
- Authentication currently uses in-memory store
- React UI is scaffold-only (needs full implementation)

## Next Steps
For Development Phase:
- Implement Dashboard with real-time WebSocket updates
- Build Process management CRUD operations
- Create visual cron builder component
- Integrate Supabase Auth UI components
- Add responsive mobile views
- Implement keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
