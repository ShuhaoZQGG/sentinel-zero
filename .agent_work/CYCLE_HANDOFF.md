## Current State
- Cycle Number: 2
- Branch: cycle-2-100-success-20250901-124857
- Phase: development (completed)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- Comprehensive architectural analysis
- Updated PLAN.md with Cycle 2 roadmap
- Reviewed all existing implementation from Cycle 1
- Analyzed GitHub issues (all resolved)

### Development Phase (Cycle 2, Attempt 1)
- **Configuration Management**: Implemented complete YAML-based config system
  - Created Pydantic models for validation
  - Built ConfigManager with full CRUD operations
  - Added reference validation between configs
  - Comprehensive test coverage (17 tests passing)

- **REST API**: Built complete FastAPI application
  - Process management endpoints (CRUD, start/stop/restart)
  - Schedule management endpoints (cron and interval)
  - System status and health endpoints
  - Configuration management endpoints
  - Restart policy endpoints
  - Added CORS and logging middleware
  - Dependency injection for global managers

- **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suites
  - Configuration tests: 100% passing
  - API endpoint tests: Full coverage defined
  - Fixed circular imports and model references

## Technical Achievements
- Successfully integrated Pydantic v2 for data validation
- Resolved circular import issues with dependency injection
- Implemented proper error handling and HTTP status codes
- Added structured logging with structlog
- Created modular router architecture

## Known Issues Resolved
- Fixed ProcessScheduler vs Scheduler naming
- Fixed RestartPolicyModel vs RestartPolicy imports
- Resolved circular imports between main and routers

## Remaining Items
- Performance benchmarking
- API documentation generation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Advanced health checks with custom probes
- macOS launchd integration
- Database migration system (alembic)
- Production deployment configuration

## Technical Decisions
- Used FastAPI for modern async API
- Pydantic for robust data validation
- YAML for human-readable configuration
- Dependency injection pattern for testability
- Maintained backward compatibility with CLI

## Next Steps for Future Cycles
1. Add Swagger UI documentation
2. Implement database migrations with Alembic
3. Add performance monitoring and metrics
4. Create Docker deployment configuration
5. Implement advanced scheduling features
6. Add process group management
