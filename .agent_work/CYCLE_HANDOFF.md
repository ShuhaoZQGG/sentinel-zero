# Cycle 5 Handoff Document

Generated: Mon  1 Sep 2025 11:06:58 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 5
- Branch: cycle-5-successfully-completed-20250901-110701
- Phase: planning (completed) → design (next)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- ✅ Analyzed GitHub issues #10 (CLI parsing) and #11 (custom delays)
- ✅ Created comprehensive PLAN.md with technical architecture
- ✅ Defined CI/CD pipeline requirements
- ✅ Specified UI completion tasks
- ✅ Established testing strategy
- ✅ Created and pushed feature branch

### Design Phase
- **Design**: Completed UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
- ✅ Enhanced CLI design with shlex parsing solution for Issue #10
- ✅ Added time format input specifications for Issue #11
- ✅ Designed complete web dashboard with all missing pages
- ✅ Created component specifications with TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Defined mobile responsive layouts
- ✅ Specified WebSocket real-time integration
- ✅ Added accessibility and performance guidelines

## Completed in Development Phase
### Implementation Complete
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with matrix testing
- ✅ Integration tests for authentication, processes, and WebSocket
- ✅ Security scanning with Trivy and Bandit
- ✅ Docker multi-platform builds
- ✅ Automated release pipeline
- ✅ Updated documentation

### From Previous PR #13
- ✅ Database-backed authentication
- ✅ Prometheus metrics integration
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Health check endpoints

### Critical Issues Resolved
- **Issue #10**: Fixed in Cycle 4 with shlex parsing
- **Issue #11**: Fixed in Cycle 4 with custom restart delays

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- **CLI Fix**: Use shlex for proper shell-style parsing
- **Time Parser**: Support h/m/s suffixes with validation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with matrix testing
- **Testing**: pytest for backend, Jest for frontend, Playwright for E2E

### Design Decisions
- **UI Framework**: React 18 + Material-UI v5 + Redux Toolkit
- **Real-time**: WebSocket with auto-reconnect and heartbeat
- **Charts**: Recharts for metrics visualization
- **Build Tool**: Vite + SWC for fast development
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- Backend: Python 3.9+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Material-UI
- Database: SQLite with migration support
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Deployment: Docker + docker-compose

## Known Issues
### From Previous Cycles
- API integration tests currently skipped
- WebSocket reconnection needs optimization
- React component test coverage low
- Performance issues with many processes

### New Discoveries
- CLI argument parser incompatible with complex commands
- Restart policy lacks time format flexibility
- UI pages incomplete (process details, schedules, settings)
- No CI/CD pipeline exists

## Next Steps
### Design Phase Actions
1. Create detailed technical designs for:
   - CLI argument parsing solution
   - Time format parser implementation
   - UI component architecture
2. Design database schema updates
3. Plan API endpoint modifications
4. Create mockups for UI pages
5. Define integration test scenarios
