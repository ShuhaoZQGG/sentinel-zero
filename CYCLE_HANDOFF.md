# Cycle Handoff Document

## Cycle 1 - Planning Phase

### Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with Core Features section
- ✅ Developed detailed project plan (PLAN.md) with:
  - Requirements analysis (functional and non-functional)
  - System architecture design
  - Technology stack selection (Python 3.11+ with psutil, APScheduler, SQLAlchemy)
  - Database schema design (SQLite)
  - Implementation phases breakdown
  - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ for rapid development and excellent process management libraries
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight, zero-configuration persistence
- **Process Monitoring**: psutil for cross-platform process management
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler for advanced scheduling with persistence
- **CLI**: click framework for intuitive command-line interface
- **Architecture**: Modular component design with clear separation of concerns

### Pending for Design Phase
- Detailed API specifications for each component
- Error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms
- Inter-process communication design
- Configuration file format (YAML vs TOML vs JSON)
- Logging format and rotation policies
- Health check protocol design

### Technical Considerations
- macOS-specific security permissions handling
- Process group management for child processes
- Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGINT)
- Zombie process prevention
- Resource monitoring thresholds
- Database migration strategy

### Next Steps (Design Phase)
1. Create detailed component interfaces
2. Design configuration schema
3. Define CLI command structure
4. Specify REST API endpoints (if applicable)
5. Design error codes and messages
6. Create sequence diagrams for critical flows

## Cycle 1 - Design Phase

### Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications (DESIGN.md) with:
  - CLI command structure and syntax
  - All core feature commands (process, schedule, policy, monitoring)
  - Output formatting and status indicators
  - Configuration file format (YAML chosen)
  - Error handling patterns and messages
  - Interactive features and auto-completion
  - Accessibility requirements
  - Performance targets
  - User journey maps

### Design Decisions
- **Configuration Format**: YAML for human readability and ease of editing
- **CLI Framework**: Confirmed click framework for rich CLI features
- **Output Formats**: Table (default), JSON, YAML for different use cases
- **Color Coding**: Status indicators with emoji and colors for clarity
- **Error Format**: Structured errors with codes, messages, and hints

### Pending for Development
- Implementation of core process manager module
- Database schema implementation with SQLAlchemy
- CLI command implementation with click
- Logging infrastructure setup
- Testing framework setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

### Technical Recommendations for Development
- **Frontend Framework**: Not applicable (CLI-based, potential future web dashboard with FastAPI + React)
- **Testing**: pytest for unit tests, click.testing for CLI tests
- **Packaging**: setuptools for distribution, homebrew formula for macOS
- **Documentation**: Sphinx for API docs, man pages for CLI
- **Monitoring**: structlog for structured logging, prometheus-client ready
