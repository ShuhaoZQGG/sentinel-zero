# Cycle Handoff Document

## Cycle 1 - Planning Phase

### Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with Core Features section
- ✅ Developed detailed project plan (PLAN.md) with:
  - Requirements analysis (functional and non-functional)
  - System architecture design
  - Technology stack selection (Python 3.11+ with psutil, APScheduler, SQLAlchemy)
  - Database schema design (SQLite)
  - Implementation phases breakdown
  - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ for rapid development and excellent process management libraries
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight, zero-configuration persistence
- **Process Monitoring**: psutil for cross-platform process management
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler for advanced scheduling with persistence
- **CLI**: click framework for intuitive command-line interface
- **Architecture**: Modular component design with clear separation of concerns

### Pending for Design Phase
- Detailed API specifications for each component
- Error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms
- Inter-process communication design
- Configuration file format (YAML vs TOML vs JSON)
- Logging format and rotation policies
- Health check protocol design

### Technical Considerations
- macOS-specific security permissions handling
- Process group management for child processes
- Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGINT)
- Zombie process prevention
- Resource monitoring thresholds
- Database migration strategy

### Next Steps (Design Phase)
1. Create detailed component interfaces
2. Design configuration schema
3. Define CLI command structure
4. Specify REST API endpoints (if applicable)
5. Design error codes and messages
6. Create sequence diagrams for critical flows
