# Cycle Handoff Document

## Cycle 1 - Planning Phase

### Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with Core Features section
- ✅ Developed detailed project plan (PLAN.md) with:
  - Requirements analysis (functional and non-functional)
  - System architecture design
  - Technology stack selection (Python 3.11+ with psutil, APScheduler, SQLAlchemy)
  - Database schema design (SQLite)
  - Implementation phases breakdown
  - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ for rapid development and excellent process management libraries
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight, zero-configuration persistence
- **Process Monitoring**: psutil for cross-platform process management
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler for advanced scheduling with persistence
- **CLI**: click framework for intuitive command-line interface
- **Architecture**: Modular component design with clear separation of concerns

### Pending for Design Phase
- Detailed API specifications for each component
- Error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms
- Inter-process communication design
- Configuration file format (YAML vs TOML vs JSON)
- Logging format and rotation policies
- Health check protocol design

### Technical Considerations
- macOS-specific security permissions handling
- Process group management for child processes
- Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGINT)
- Zombie process prevention
- Resource monitoring thresholds
- Database migration strategy

### Next Steps (Design Phase)
1. Create detailed component interfaces
2. Design configuration schema
3. Define CLI command structure
4. Specify REST API endpoints (if applicable)
5. Design error codes and messages
6. Create sequence diagrams for critical flows

## Cycle 1 - Design Phase

### Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications (DESIGN.md) with:
  - CLI command structure and syntax
  - All core feature commands (process, schedule, policy, monitoring)
  - Output formatting and status indicators
  - Configuration file format (YAML chosen)
  - Error handling patterns and messages
  - Interactive features and auto-completion
  - Accessibility requirements
  - Performance targets
  - User journey maps

### Design Decisions
- **Configuration Format**: YAML for human readability and ease of editing
- **CLI Framework**: Confirmed click framework for rich CLI features
- **Output Formats**: Table (default), JSON, YAML for different use cases
- **Color Coding**: Status indicators with emoji and colors for clarity
- **Error Format**: Structured errors with codes, messages, and hints

### Pending for Development
- Implementation of core process manager module
- Database schema implementation with SQLAlchemy
- CLI command implementation with click
- Logging infrastructure setup
- Testing framework setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

### Technical Recommendations for Development
- **Frontend Framework**: Not applicable (CLI-based, potential future web dashboard with FastAPI + React)
- **Testing**: pytest for unit tests, click.testing for CLI tests
- **Packaging**: setuptools for distribution, homebrew formula for macOS
- **Documentation**: Sphinx for API docs, man pages for CLI
- **Monitoring**: structlog for structured logging, prometheus-client ready

## Cycle 1 - Development Phase (Attempt 1)

### Completed
- ✅ Created GitHub repository and configured remote
- ✅ Set up project structure following architecture plan
- ✅ Implemented core process management module with TDD:
  - Process starting/stopping with signal handling
  - Process monitoring with psutil
  - Output capture (stdout/stderr)
  - Environment variable injection
  - Working directory configuration
  - Process group management
  - Resource metrics collection
- ✅ Implemented scheduler module with APScheduler:
  - Cron expression support
  - Interval-based scheduling
  - One-time task execution
  - Schedule enable/disable functionality
  - Next run time calculation
- ✅ Implemented restart policy module:
  - Configurable retry policies
  - Exponential backoff support
  - Exit code-based conditional restarts
  - Built-in policies (standard, aggressive, conservative, none)
- ✅ Set up database models with SQLAlchemy:
  - Process, Schedule, RestartPolicy, ProcessLog, Metric models
  - SQLite database with relationships
- ✅ Implemented basic CLI commands:
  - start, stop, restart, status, list, logs commands
  - Rich terminal output with tables and formatting
  - Process metrics display
- ✅ All tests passing (28 tests total)

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Process Management**: Used subprocess.Popen with process groups for proper signal handling
- **Monitoring**: Background thread monitors process status changes
- **Scheduler**: APScheduler with background scheduler for reliable execution
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for persistence
- **CLI**: Click framework with Rich for beautiful terminal output
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests with mocking for external dependencies

### Pending Features for Future Cycles
- Web dashboard with real-time metrics
- Process dependency management
- Distributed process management
- Integration with macOS launchd
- Webhook notifications
- Process templates and profiles
- Resource allocation limits
- Container support
- Advanced health checks
- Log rotation and management
- Configuration file support
- REST API implementation

### Known Issues
- Tests use small sleep delays for process state verification
- No integration tests yet
- CLI needs more comprehensive error handling
- Database migrations not yet implemented
- No configuration file loading yet
