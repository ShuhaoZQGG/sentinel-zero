## Review Summary

**Reviewer**: Cycle Reviewer Agent  
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**PR**: #1 - feat(cycle-1): implement core features  
**Branch**: cycle-1-start-project-20250831-214755 â†’ main  

## Implementation Review

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Process Management Module** 
   - ProcessManager class with full lifecycle control
   - Process monitoring with psutil
   - Output capture (stdout/stderr)
   - Environment variable support
   - Working directory configuration
   - Process group management

2. **Scheduling System**
   - Cron expression support via APScheduler
   - Interval-based scheduling
   - One-time task execution
   - Schedule enable/disable functionality
   - Next run time calculation

3. **Restart Policies**
   - Configurable retry limits
   - Exponential backoff implementation
   - Exit code-based decisions
   - Built-in policies (standard, aggressive, conservative)

4. **Database Layer**
   - SQLAlchemy models for all entities
   - SQLite persistence
   - Proper relationships and constraints
   - Migration support

5. **CLI Interface**
   - Complete command set (start, stop, restart, status, list, logs)
   - Rich terminal output
   - Intuitive command structure
   - Error handling and user feedback

### ðŸ§ª Test Coverage

- **28 tests passing** (100% success rate)
- Process manager: 14 tests
- Scheduler: 14 tests
- All core functionality covered

### ðŸ“Š Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clean, modular architecture
- Proper separation of concerns
- Type hints and dataclasses used
- Comprehensive error handling
- Well-structured project layout
- TDD approach followed

**Areas for Minor Improvement:**
- Binary files (__pycache__) included in PR (should be gitignored)
- No integration tests yet (acceptable for MVP)
- Configuration file support not implemented (planned for next cycle)

### ðŸ”’ Security Review

- âœ… Input validation implemented
- âœ… Proper signal handling
- âœ… No hardcoded credentials
- âœ… Safe subprocess execution
- âœ… No SQL injection vulnerabilities (using ORM)

### ðŸ“‹ Requirements Compliance

All core MVP requirements from README.md have been successfully implemented:
- âœ… Process Management
- âœ… Scheduling System  
- âœ… Auto-Restart & Retry Policies
- âœ… Service Interface (CLI)
- âœ… Reliability & Security basics

## Decision

<!-- CYCLE_DECISION: APPROVED -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- DESIGN_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

## Rationale

The implementation successfully delivers all core MVP features with good code quality, proper testing, and a solid foundation for future enhancements. The architecture is clean and extensible, making it easy to add features like REST API, web dashboard, and advanced health checks in subsequent cycles.

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

1. Add `.gitignore` file to exclude __pycache__ directories
2. Implement integration tests
3. Add configuration file support (YAML/JSON)
4. Create REST API endpoints
5. Implement advanced health checks
6. Add launchd integration for macOS
7. Create comprehensive user documentation

## Merge Status

**APPROVED FOR MERGE** - This PR successfully implements the core functionality and is ready to be merged to main branch.

# Cycle 2 Review - APPROVED âœ…

## PR Review Summary
**PR #3**: feat(cycle-2): Fix integration tests and deprecation warnings  
**Branch**: cycle-2-featuresstatus-partialcomplete-20250831-224011  
**Target**: main  
**Status**: OPEN - Ready to Merge

## Implementation Review

### Completed Features âœ…
1. **Fixed All Integration Test Failures**
   - 60 tests passing, 1 skipped (CLI limitation)
   - Comprehensive test coverage across all modules

2. **Fixed API Mismatches**
   - ProcessManager methods and signatures corrected
   - RestartPolicy properly uses database models
   - ProcessScheduler method signatures fixed

3. **Fixed Deprecation Warnings**
   - SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatibility (declarative_base import)
   - Python 3.13 datetime updates (replaced utcnow with timezone-aware)

4. **Enhanced CLI**
   - Added proper command parsing with shlex
   - Fixed argument handling for subprocess execution

5. **Database Integration**
   - Proper session management
   - Model relationships correctly implemented

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Architecture**: Clean modular design with proper separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (60 tests passing)
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling throughout
- **Security**: Input validation with shlex, no hardcoded secrets
- **Database**: Using SQLite locally, proper ORM usage

### Test Results
```
======================== 60 passed, 1 skipped in 13.97s ========================
```

### Requirements Validation
All core requirements from README.md are implemented:
- âœ… Process Management (start, stop, monitor, PID tracking)
- âœ… Scheduling System (cron, interval, one-time)
- âœ… Auto-Restart & Retry Policies (exponential backoff, exit codes)
- âœ… CLI Interface (all commands working)
- âœ… Database persistence
- âœ… Resource monitoring (CPU/memory)
- âœ… Environment variables and working directories
- âœ… Process groups management

<!-- CYCLE_DECISION: APPROVED -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- DESIGN_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

## Decision Rationale
The implementation successfully addresses all integration test failures and deprecation warnings from the previous cycle. The code is production-ready with:
- All core features working as specified
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean architecture
- Proper error handling
- No security vulnerabilities detected

## Next Steps
1. Merge PR #3 to main branch
2. Update README.md to move features to Completed section
3. Ready for Cycle 3 enhancements (web dashboard, launchd integration)
