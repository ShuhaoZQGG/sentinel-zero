# SentinelZero Implementation Summary

## Cycle 6 - Bug Fixes Implementation

### Completed Features ✅

#### Issue #10: CLI Argument Parsing for Long Strings
**Problem**: The CLI couldn't handle long strings in `-c` and `--args` options, causing "unexpected extra argument" errors.

**Solution**:
- Added `shlex` module for proper command parsing
- Modified `start` command to use `shlex.split()` 
- Commands with quoted strings are now correctly tokenized
- Both `-c` and `--args` options properly handle long strings with spaces
- Fixed database handling to avoid unique constraint errors

#### Issue #11: Custom Restart Delay with Time Formats
**Problem**: Users couldn't specify custom restart delays with human-readable time formats (e.g., "5h").

**Solution**:
- Created `src/utils/time_parser.py` with `parse_time_to_seconds()` function
- Supports formats: `5h`, `30m`, `45s`, `2d`, and combined formats like `1h30m`
- Added `--restart-delay` option to the `start` command
- Enhanced `restart` command with `--delay` option supporting time formats
- Added `restart-policy` group commands (create, list, update) with time format support
- Maintains backward compatibility with numeric values

### Test Coverage
- ✅ 12 comprehensive tests added
- All tests passing (100% success rate)
- 3 tests for CLI argument parsing
- 9 tests for time format parsing and restart delays

## Cycle 1 - Core Features Implementation

### Completed Features ✅

#### 1. Process Management Module
- Full process lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)
- Real-time process monitoring with psutil
- Output capture and streaming
- Environment variable injection
- Working directory configuration
- Process group management for related processes
- Resource metrics collection (CPU, memory, threads)

#### 2. Scheduling System
- Cron expression support for complex schedules
- Interval-based scheduling (seconds, minutes, hours, days)
- One-time task execution
- Schedule persistence and management
- Enable/disable functionality
- Next run time calculation

#### 3. Restart Policies
- Configurable retry count and delays
- Exponential backoff algorithm
- Exit code-based conditional restarts
- Built-in policies: standard, aggressive, conservative, none
- Per-process policy application

#### 4. Database Layer
- SQLAlchemy models for all entities
- SQLite for lightweight persistence
- Relationships between processes, schedules, and policies
- Process logs and metrics storage

#### 5. CLI Interface
- Intuitive command structure with Click
- Rich terminal output with tables and colors
- Process status monitoring
- Log viewing capabilities
- Resource metrics display

### Test Coverage
- 28 comprehensive unit tests
- Process manager tests: 14 passing
- Scheduler tests: 14 passing
- All core functionality tested with TDD approach

### Technical Stack
- **Python 3.11+**: Main language
- **psutil**: Process monitoring
- **APScheduler**: Advanced scheduling
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM
- **Click**: CLI framework
- **Rich**: Terminal formatting
- **structlog**: Structured logging
- **pytest**: Testing framework
