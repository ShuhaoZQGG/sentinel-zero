# SentinelZero Implementation Summary

## Cycle 1 - Core Features Implementation

### Completed Features ✅

#### 1. Process Management Module
- Full process lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)
- Real-time process monitoring with psutil
- Output capture and streaming
- Environment variable injection
- Working directory configuration
- Process group management for related processes
- Resource metrics collection (CPU, memory, threads)

#### 2. Scheduling System
- Cron expression support for complex schedules
- Interval-based scheduling (seconds, minutes, hours, days)
- One-time task execution
- Schedule persistence and management
- Enable/disable functionality
- Next run time calculation

#### 3. Restart Policies
- Configurable retry count and delays
- Exponential backoff algorithm
- Exit code-based conditional restarts
- Built-in policies: standard, aggressive, conservative, none
- Per-process policy application

#### 4. Database Layer
- SQLAlchemy models for all entities
- SQLite for lightweight persistence
- Relationships between processes, schedules, and policies
- Process logs and metrics storage

#### 5. CLI Interface
- Intuitive command structure with Click
- Rich terminal output with tables and colors
- Process status monitoring
- Log viewing capabilities
- Resource metrics display

### Test Coverage
- 28 comprehensive unit tests
- Process manager tests: 14 passing
