# Next Cycle Tasks - SentinelZero

## Cycle 3 Review Update
**Status**: PR #8 Merged - Enterprise features implemented
**Date**: 2025-09-01

### Completed in Cycle 3
- ✅ REST API with FastAPI (full CRUD, JWT auth, WebSocket)
- ✅ React Dashboard UI (real-time monitoring, Material-UI)
- ✅ macOS launchd integration (service files, installation scripts)
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates
- ✅ Redux state management with TypeScript

## Cycle 4 - High Priority Tasks

### 1. Database-Backed Authentication
- **Why**: Current in-memory auth store is not production-ready
- **Scope**: 
  - Set up PostgreSQL for user management
  - Migrate from in-memory store to database
  - Implement proper session management
  - Add user registration/management endpoints
  - Implement refresh token persistence

### 2. Complete Remaining UI Pages
- **Why**: Dashboard scaffolding exists but pages are incomplete
- **Scope**:
  - Process Details page with log viewer and filtering
  - Schedules management interface with CRUD operations
  - Settings configuration page
  - User profile/authentication pages
  - Mobile responsive design

### 3. Prometheus Metrics Integration
- **Why**: Enterprise monitoring and observability
- **Scope**:
  - Export metrics in Prometheus format
  - Add custom metrics for business logic
  - Create Grafana dashboard templates
  - Historical metrics storage in time-series DB
  - Alert rule configuration

## Cycle 4 - Medium Priority Tasks

### 4. Docker Deployment
- **Why**: Simplify deployment and distribution
- **Scope**:
  - Create multi-stage Dockerfile
  - Docker-compose for full stack
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Volume management for persistence
  - Health check endpoints

### 5. API Documentation Enhancement
- **Why**: Improve developer experience
- **Scope**:
  - Add comprehensive API examples
  - Create Postman/Insomnia collections
  - Interactive API playground (Swagger UI)
  - SDK generation for Python/JS/Go
  - Rate limiting documentation

### 6. End-to-End Testing
- **Why**: Ensure UI reliability
- **Scope**:
  - Playwright or Cypress setup
  - Critical user journey tests
  - Visual regression testing
  - CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
  - Performance testing

## Low Priority Tasks (Future Cycles)

### 7. Advanced Monitoring Features
- Custom health check scripts
- Webhook notifications (Slack, Discord, email)
- Alert threshold configuration
- Predictive failure analysis with ML
- Distributed tracing

### 8. Configuration Management
- YAML/JSON config file support
- Hot-reload capability
- Environment-specific configs
- Secrets management (Vault integration)
- Configuration versioning

### 9. Mobile Application
- React Native or Flutter app
- Push notifications
- Mobile-optimized UI
- Offline capability
- Biometric authentication

## Technical Debt from Previous Cycles

### From Cycle 3
1. **API Integration Tests**: Currently skipped, need running server setup
2. **WebSocket Reconnection**: Needs production testing and optimization
3. **React Component Tests**: Add unit tests for UI components
4. **Performance Optimization**: Dashboard rendering with many processes
5. **Log Rotation**: Implement proper log management and archival

### From Earlier Cycles
1. **Code Coverage**: Add coverage reporting to CI/CD
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Set up formatting and linting
3. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections
4. **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses across API

## Security Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Add API rate limiting per user/IP
2. **Audit Logging**: Track all administrative actions
3. **RBAC**: Role-based access control for multi-user scenarios
4. **Secrets Management**: Integrate with HashiCorp Vault
5. **Security Headers**: Implement OWASP recommended headers
6. **2FA**: Two-factor authentication support

## Architecture Improvements

1. **Microservices Split**: Consider separating API, scheduler, and monitor
2. **Message Queue**: Add Redis/RabbitMQ for async operations
3. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis caching for frequent queries
4. **Load Balancing**: Support multiple API instances
5. **Database Optimization**: Add indexes, connection pooling
6. **Event Sourcing**: Implement event-driven architecture

## Documentation Needs

1. **User Guide**: Comprehensive end-user documentation
2. **Administrator Guide**: Deployment and configuration guide
3. **Developer Guide**: Contributing guidelines and architecture docs
4. **API Reference**: Complete OpenAPI documentation
5. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
6. **Video Tutorials**: Getting started and advanced features

## Recommended Cycle 4 Focus

Based on the current state and priorities, Cycle 4 should focus on:

1. **Database Authentication** (Critical for production) - 1 week
2. **Complete UI Pages** (User experience completion) - 1 week
3. **Docker Deployment** (Distribution and deployment) - 3 days
4. **E2E Testing** (Quality assurance) - 3 days
5. **API Documentation** (Developer experience) - 2 days

These tasks will make SentinelZero production-ready with a complete user experience and professional deployment options.

## Success Metrics for Cycle 4

- Database authentication with <100ms response time
- 100% UI page completion with responsive design
- Docker image size <100MB
- E2E test coverage for critical paths
- API documentation with >20 examples
- Zero security vulnerabilities in OWASP scan
